-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

scope
------

i)Global scope
eg;
var a=10;
console.log("this is global scope");

ii)Block scope
eg;
{
    let b=50;
    console.log("this area is block scope");
    
}

iii)Local scope or Function scope
eg;
function abc(){
    letc=40;
    console.log("this area is local scope");
    
}
abc()


< --! data types--->
  
  it is used to define which kind  or what type of data is stored in the variable

                            Data Type
                               |
       ______________________________________________
     |                                               |
  primitive                                       non premitive
     |                                               |
  number                                          Array
  boolean                                         Object
  string                                          function
  undefined
  null
  Bigint

  <!number-->

              in number datatype we can store decimal as well as non decimal number.
  <---note---->
            typeof operator is used to know the data of any variable.

            eg;
               let a=10;
               let b=20;
               console.log(typeof a)//number
               console.log(typeof a)// number

<--parseInt-->
    This method is used to convert anything into Integer value

eg;
let num4=Number.parseInt(43.2);
console.log(num4);//output=43
console.log(typeof num4);


let num5=Number.parseInt("40");
console.log(num5);//output=40
console.log(typeof num5);

let num6=Number.parseInt("ab50abc");
console.log(num6)//output=NaN
console.log(typeof num6);

let a="20ab"
console.log(a);//output=20
let b="ab20"
console.log(b);//output=NaN

<---- boolean---->
        
         it can take true or false
     
         eg;
            let isodd= true;
            
            console.log(isodd);//output=true;
            console.log(typeof isodd); //output=boolean

<----String----->
           String is a combination of single or multiple character.

           In javascript we can enclose the string by "",''.``.

eg;
           let str1="good morning everyone"
           console.log(str1);
           console.log(typeof str1);

           let str2='good evening everyone'// here single quote is also consider as string not a character;
           console.log(str2);
           console.log(typeof str2);

           let str3=`good night everyone`//it is also consider as a string
           console.log(str3);
           console.log(typeof str3);    
<---undefined----->
            Variable is declared but not initialized .

            tyoeof od undefined is undefined.
eg;
            let salary;
            console.log(salary);//Output=undefined
            console.log(typeof salary); //Output=undefined       

<-----Null--->
            Null is used to store as nothing in variable.

            it behaves as value what we have storing in the variable.

            type of null is object.

     eg;
            let salar=null;
            console.log(salary);  // null
            console.log(typeof salary) // object
<---Bigint--->
            it is used to store big integer value in any variable.

            bigintsuffix will be n.

      eg;
            int largenumber=2n;
            console.log(largenumber);  //2n
            console.log(typeof largenumber)   //Bigint  

<-----hoisting--->
            Moving the decleration top of the respective scope is known as hoisting.

                     There are two types they are
                          *Variable hoisting
                          *functional hoisting
1.variable hoisting
  1.by using var keyword
                Decleration goes to the top of the scope and value initialised as undefined till actual initialization.thats why if we try to access before actual initialization will be get undefined.
  2.by using  let and const keyword
                Decleration is go to the top of the scope and value will not be assigned till actual initialization.if we are try to access before actual initialization we will get reference error due to TD7.
                    (or)
            
<---- variable hoisting--->
            if we have declared any variable by using var keyword and we are trying to access that before its decleration, output will be undefined.   

            Because that decleration part will moving to the top.this is called variable hoisting.
eg;
            console.log(a)  // undefined because the decleration part will be moving to the top and give the output as undefined.

            var a=20; 
            -----  this move to top
<----- what is the difference between == and ===?--->

==  will check only the values
=== it will check value with datatype

console.log("20" =="20")  //true
console.log("20" === "20") //false

2.Functional hoisting
       Entire function goes to top of the scope thats why we can call the function before decleration.still it will work.
